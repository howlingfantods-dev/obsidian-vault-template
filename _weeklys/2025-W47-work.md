## 📉 Last Week
- More comfortable with payment methods migrations
- Crazy linears where it was impossible to map payment method to client  
- Devised at a high level how my video migration pipeline should work
- Adhoc video migrations a lot quicker (didnt have to fuss with coding much)
- Did a little experiementing with docker images for the orchestrator and worker
## ⏳ Upcoming
- Uscreen client still in the pipeline.
- A lot of migrations this week
- Hanging out with Jordan on saturday
## 🎯  Goals
- Start construction the pipeline to work for vimeo. If we could finish it that'd be awesome because we're gonna need to abstract it out for uscreen
