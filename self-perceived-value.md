# 💡 Ideas
- I want peace from want. My want comes from the desire to be seen as high value. There are people out there that I do mean something to and I feel nothing. I think it has to be a significant other or a woman.
- The next step is to find the value in myself. To give my self grace and kindess when I fall short.
